Hello, World!
<br/><br/>
With the help of Google Gemini, I've been building an interactive version of my resume.
<br/><br/>
It was fun, and it was scary.
<br/><br/>
It is not just AI that did the work: this little project has been in the back of my mind since many years. Back then, I would have obtained a much simpler result, that would still display the same "personality" behind the app.
<br/><br/>
Today, the same "product" and the same "personality" can be displayed in a polished way by leveraging AI as a technology, not a replacement.
<br/><br/>
Enough words! Why don't you give it a try? It's interactive!
<br/><br/>

PS: I could not resist dropping a few Easter eggs here and there in the app. :)
